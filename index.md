I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at University of California, Davis, where I am currently being advised by [Professor Zubair Shafiq](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~zubair/index.html). My research interests revolve around making internet private and secure for all netizens through use of modern machine learning and data analytics techniques.
